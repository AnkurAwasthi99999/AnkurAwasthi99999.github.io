        <h1>Calcined Petroleum Coke (CPC)</h1>

        <p>CPC is a form of highly electrically conductive, dense Carbon with very low specific Electrical Resistance, and having fixed Carbon of approximately 99.5%.</p>

        <p>CPC is used extensively as Anode in Alumina Smelters, as Soderberg's Electrode for Ferroalloy Industries, and in the manufacturing of Graphite/ Graphite Electrodes, and Thermal Paste for Ferro Alloys & allied industries in Submerged Arc Furnaces.</p>

        <p>CPC is also used in various Steel Industries for - Melting of Steel, Recurburisation, and for making Special Steels & Alloys.</p>

        <h2>Calcination Process</h2>

        <p>Raw Coke is Calcined to develop specific properties to make it suitable for industrial purposes. The Calcination (of Raw Coke) involves controlled heating of the Raw Coke to the temperature in the range of 1250°C to 1350°C. This process drives off moisture, hydrocarbons, and other volatile matter present in the Raw Coke is burnt off - thereby densified the particles and changes the electrical properties from insulating to conducting. Raw Coke after Calcination is known as Calcined Petroleum Coke. At India Carbon, Calcination is performed in an oil-fired rotary kiln with suitable refractories. Raw Coke crushed into lumps is fed through Conveyor System to the slightly elevated end of the rotary kiln. The coke progresses towards the firing end of the kiln and during its passage down the kiln any moisture present is driven off by the counter current of hot combustion gases. Volatile (Hydrocarbon) present in the Raw Coke also evolves and burns as the temperature increases, providing additional heat energy to the calcination process.</p>

        <h2>Manufacturing Process</h2>

        <p>The burner is regulated only to achieve the desired final temperature. When the Coke reaches the firing end at the kiln, it drops into a chute and is led into a rotary cooler positioned beneath the kiln. The cooler is equipped with water spray to directly quench and cool the Coke. The amount of cooling water is controlled so that the coke does not get wet and remains dry within the limit of moisture content. The cooled Calcined Coke coming out of the cooler is then routed by the conveyor system to bulk storage and further bagged for shipment to customers.</p>
