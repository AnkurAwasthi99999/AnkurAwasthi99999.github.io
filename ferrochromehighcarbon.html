        <h3>Ferro Chrome Specification</h3>
  

   

        <p>
            Ferro Chrome (Ferro Chromium) is an iron alloy whose main components are chromium and iron, and the chromium content is between 50% and 70%. In addition to the main components of chromium and iron, it also contains impurities such as carbon, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus. Ferro chrome is often used as an important alloy additive in steel smelting and foundry industries.
        </p>

        <h3>Classification Of Ferro Chrome</h3>
        <p>
            According to the different carbon content in ferro chrome, ferrochrome can be divided into four types.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>High-carbon ferrochrome: the carbon content ranges from 4 to 8%;</li>
            <li>Medium carbon ferrochrome: carbon content is between 0.5~4%;</li>
            <li>Low-carbon ferrochrome: carbon content is between 0.15~0.5%;</li>
            <li>Micro-carbon ferrochrome: the carbon content ranges from 0.06 to 0.15%.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ferro chrome with different carbon content is suitable for different application scenarios.
        </p>

        <h3>Application Of Ferro Chromium</h3>
        <p>
            Ferrochromium is mainly used in steelmaking and welding industry.
        </p>

        <h4>1. High-carbon ferrochrome</h4>
        <p>
            High-carbon ferrochrome is usually used as an alloying agent for ball steel (0.5%～1.45%Cr), tool steel, die steel (5%～12%Cr), and high-speed steel (3.8%～4.4%Cr), and can harden steel. Increase the wear resistance and hardness of steel.
        </p>
        <p>
            High carbon ferro chrome is used in the casting industry. It can improve the heat resistance and hardness of the cast iron.
        </p>
        <p>
            High carbon ferro chrome is used in the production of silicon chrome, medium, and low carbon ferro chrome.
        </p>
        <p>
            High carbon ferro chrome powder is used in the production of welding rods.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Medium and low-carbon ferrochrome</h4>
        <p>
            Medium and low-carbon ferrochrome is used in the production of medium and low-carbon structural steel, carburizing steel, gears, high-pressure blower blades, valve plates, etc.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Micro-carbon ferrochrome</h4>
        <p>
            Micro-carbon ferrochrome is mainly used to produce stainless steel, wear-resistant steel, and heat-resistant steel.
        </p>
